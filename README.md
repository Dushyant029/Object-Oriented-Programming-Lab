# OOPS Guidebook -- UNDER CONSTRUCTION
This is your guidebook to Object Oriented Programming in C++

## What is Object Oriented Programming?
Object-oriented programming (OOP) is a programming paradigm based on the concept of "objects", which may contain data, in the form of fields, often known as attributes; and code, in the form of procedures, often known as methods.

## Why C++
 * C++ is a highly portable language and is often the language of choice for multi-device, multi-platform app development.
 * C++ is an object-oriented programming language and includes classes, inheritance, polymorphism, data abstraction and encapsulation.
 * C++ has a rich function library.
 * C++ allows exception handling, and function overloading which are not possible in C.
 * C++ is a powerful, efficient and fast language. It finds a wide range of applications â€“ from GUI applications to 3D graphics for games to real-time mathematical simulations.
