## Practise Expressions and conditional statements

### Question 1
A pharmaceutical company gives a 2% discount if the remaining balance is
paid within 10 days of purchase. Given the BillAmount, BuyingDay,
PayingDay of a customer, write an alogirthm and C program to print
the amount to be paid. Assume that the BuyingDay and PayingDay are
in the same month and year. For example, if the Billamount is 100.00,
BuyingDay is 12 and PayingDay is 20 then amount to be paid is 98.00.
Whereas when the Billamount is 100.00, BuyingDay is 12 and PayingDay is
23 then amount to be paid is 100.00. Print only two decimal places for the amount to be paid.
<br />
<b>Input Format</b> <br />
First line contains the BillAmount
<br />
Second line contains the BuyingDay
<br />
Third line contains the PayingDay
<b>Output Format</b> <br />
Print the amount to be paid with only two decimal places
<br /> <br />

### Question 2
Given a three digit identification number, the identification number
is said to be valid if sum of square of the digits is divisible by 10.
Given an identification number, develop an algorithm and write the C code
to print ‘Valid’ or ‘Invalid’. For example, 505, 608 are valid and number 444 is invalid.
<br />
<b>Input Format</b><br />
First line contains a three digit identification number<br />
<b>Output format</b>
Print either Valid or Invalid
<br /><br />

### Question 3
Part-time employees are paid ‘x’ amount for each 40-hours they work and for the remaining hours they are paid ‘y’ amount. A part-time employee has worked ‘z’ hours per day for six days. Given the value of ‘x’ and ‘y’ and ‘z’, develop an algorithm and write a C code to find the amount to be paid. For example, if the value of x is 2000, ‘y’ is 100 and ‘z’ is 15 then the amount to be paid is 5000.


<br />
<b>Input Format</b><br />
First line contains amount paid for each 40 hours, x

Second line contains amount paid for each extra hour, y

Third line contains number of hours worked per day, z<br />
<b>Output format</b>
Print the amount to be paid
<br /><br />

### Question 4
The following is a hypothetical condition. There are different cadre of employees in railways department. There are four cadres of employees ‘A’, ‘B’, ‘C’ and ‘D’. Each cadre has different rate of discount as follows:

‘A’ – 10%

‘B’ - 8%

‘C’ – 6%

‘D’ – 5%

Given the cadre of employee, develop an algorithm and write the ‘C’ program to print the rate of discount for the employee. The input shall be given in upper or lower case letter. Print ‘Invalid input’ if the input is any other character


<br />
<b>Input Format</b><br />
First line contains the cadre of employee, this input shall be given in upper or lower case<br />
<b>Output format</b>
Print the discount percentage for the employee. Print ‘%’ symbol at the end of the output
<br /><br />

### Question 4
Given a character, depending on the character write an algorithm and C program to print ‘You have entered an alphabet’ if the character entered is a letter or ‘You have entered a digit’ if the character entered is a number and ‘You have entered a special character’ otherwise.

<br />
<b>Input Format</b><br />

First line contains the character entered by the user<br />
<b>Output format</b>
Print either

You have entered an alphabet or

You have entered a digit or

You have entered a special character
<br /><br />
