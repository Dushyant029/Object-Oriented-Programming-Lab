# Linear Search

## Algorithm
```
STEP 1: Initialize the position variable as -1
STEP 2: Start from the leftmost element of array and one by one compare x with each element of array
STEP 3: If x matches with an element, store the value of index in position variable
STEP 3: If the final value of position variable is -1 => the element does not exist
```
